## Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning

**Introduction:**

In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a face mask has become essential to reduce the spread of the virus. Automated face mask detection systems can help enforce mask-wearing rules in public spaces. This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting whether a person is wearing a mask or not using images. The model uses MobileNetV2 as the base model for transfer learning and applies image data augmentation techniques to improve performance. Additionally, we implement the YOLO v4 object detection model for real-time detection.

**Objective:**

The project's main objective is to develop a deep learning-based face mask detection system that accurately identifies whether individuals are wearing masks, assisting in monitoring and ensuring compliance with public health regulations. To achieve this, the project will utilize a dataset of images, employ MobileNetV2 with transfer learning techniques to create the face mask classifier, and implement a data augmentation pipeline to enhance the classifier's generalization capabilities. The resulting system will be an efficient and reliable tool for monitoring mask usage in various public settings.


YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) is a highly efficient and accurate object detection model that has been designed for real-time applications. It builds upon the principles of previous YOLO versions while incorporating cutting-edge techniques and architectural innovations to optimize both speed and accuracy. The YOLOv4 model consists of several key components:

Backbone: CSPDarknet53 - The backbone of YOLOv4 is the CSPDarknet53, a novel architecture derived from Darknet53 with Cross-Stage Hierarchical Networks (CSHNet). This structure enhances the model's ability to learn better features by incorporating feature fusion at various levels.

Neck: PANet and SPP - The neck of the model comprises a Path Aggregation Network (PANet) that allows for better information flow between different layers of the architecture. Additionally, the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module aids in capturing different scale features, resulting in improved object detection capabilities.

Head: YOLOv3 - The YOLOv3 head is used for prediction, maintaining the anchor-based approach for bounding box regression and class prediction while utilizing three different scales for detecting objects of varying sizes.

Bag of Freebies and Bag of Specials: YOLOv4 employs various data augmentation techniques, collectively called the "Bag of Freebies," and architectural modifications, referred to as the "Bag of Specials." These optimizations significantly boost the model's performance without substantial computational overhead.

Spatial Attention Module (SAM): This component is used to improve the focus on crucial spatial information in the feature maps, which helps increase the model's detection accuracy.

Mish Activation Function: YOLOv4 uses the Mish activation function, a non-monotonic and smooth activation function that helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and contributes to better training outcomes.

YOLOv4's combination of these components, along with advanced training techniques, results in an object detection model that excels in both speed and accuracy. It is well-suited for real-time object detection applications, making it a popular choice for various computer vision tasks.
